✋ Control Applications Using Hand Gestures with Python and Computer Vision  
🧭 Overview

This project presents a **real-time gesture recognition system** that allows users to control desktop applications using **hand gestures** captured from a webcam. It is built with **Python**, using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**

📊 Hand Gestures

The system supports gesture recognition such as:

- 🖐️ **Five fingers** → Open Notepad
- ✊ **No fingers** (fist) → Close Notepad


🧠 System Architecture

- 📷 Webcam input using OpenCV
- 🤖 Hand detection & landmark tracking using MediaPipe
- ✋ Custom logic to count fingers
- ⚙️ System automation using PyAutoGUI

🧪 Sample Results

- Detected 5 fingers → ✅ Launched Notepad  
- Detected fist → ✅ Closed Notepad
